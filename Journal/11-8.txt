Figured out how to transition from BirthdayChecker to the MainMenu. However, the current color scheme of the main menue is to bland.

Tasks:
  1. Complete lab 10
  2. Get a search function for both ingredients and Recipes up and running.
  3. Make changes to current code if needed.
  4. Figure out smooth transition.
