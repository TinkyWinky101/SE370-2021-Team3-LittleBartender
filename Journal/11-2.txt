The birthday checker worked splendidly, although I need to figure out a way to activate the main menu after the birthday has been confirmed. Nevertheless, the foundations have 
been partially set and with time, the project should be 25% completed. 

Tasks:
  1. Complete lab 9.
  2. Create a main menu
  3. Figure out a way to make the transition seem seamless.
